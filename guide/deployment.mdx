# Deployment of Themis Application

The Themis wizard application is a Next.js project, which is optimized for deployment on Vercel. Vercel provides a seamless deployment experience for Next.js applications, including automatic scaling, global CDN, and serverless functions.

### Automatic Sync with v0.dev

This project is automatically synced with your deployments on [v0.dev](https://v0.dev). Any changes you make to your deployed app through v0's interface will be automatically pushed to your connected Git repository, and Vercel will deploy the latest version from that repository.

You can find the deployment status and links in your project's `README.md` file:

### Environment Variables

While the current Themis application does not explicitly use environment variables, a production Next.js application often requires them for sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or third-party service configurations.

On Vercel, you can manage environment variables through your project settings in the Vercel Dashboard.
*   **Server-side environment variables**: These are accessible only on the server (e.g., in Server Actions, Route Handlers, or Server Components).
*   **Client-side environment variables**: To be accessible on the client, they must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

For example, if you had an API key:
1.  Add `MY_API_KEY=your_secret_key` in your Vercel project settings.
2.  Access it in your server-side code: `process.env.MY_API_KEY`.
3.  If needed on the client, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXX` and access it as `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID`.

### Further Deployment Considerations

*   **Custom Domains**: You can easily configure custom domains for your Vercel deployment through the Vercel Dashboard.
*   **Monitoring and Logs**: Vercel provides built-in monitoring and logging for your deployments, which are essential for debugging and understanding application performance in production.
*   **Rollbacks**: Vercel keeps a history of your deployments, allowing you to instantly roll back to a previous version if needed.
